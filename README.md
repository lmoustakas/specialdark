AAS 2016 January special session on dark matter metrics, with a view to crossing conceptual and focus gaps across astronomical approaches to dark matter, and particle physics. 

A full description of the session's goals is given in the original proposal to the AAS, [here](https://github.com/lmoustakas/specialdark/blob/master/docs/DMSpecialSessionProposal.pdf).
