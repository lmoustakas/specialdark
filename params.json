{"name":"Astrophysical Constraints of Dark Matter Properties","tagline":"A Special Session at the 227th American Astronomical Society meeting","body":"# Special Session on the Astrophysical Constraints of Dark Matter Properties\r\n\r\n## Thursday, January 7, 2016, 2:00pm - 3:30pm\r\n\r\nWhat is dark matter, and how can astronomical observations give insights or measurements of its detailed particle properties? How do we coordinate work across vast astronomical approaches? How best can astronomers and particle physicists share ideas and advances?  Come to this session to learn new ideas on this front, and to contribute to the discussion! \r\n\r\nThe rationale for this Special Session is made in the original proposal submitted to the AAS, available here. \r\n\r\n## Organizers and conveners\r\n\r\nTom Abel (Stanford) & Alex Drlica-Wagner (FNAL) & Justin Read (Surrey) & Alyson Brooks (Rutgers) & Jennifer Gaskins (Amsterdam) &     Josh Simon (OCIW) & Matthew Buckley (Rutgers) & Manoj Kaplinghat (UCI) & Rachel Somerville (Rutgers) & James Bullock (UCI)           & Charles Keeton (Rutgers) & Erik Tollerud (STScI) & Michelle Collins (Surrey) & Stacy Kim (OSU) & Tommaso Treu (UCLA) & Francis-Yan Cyr-Racine (Harvard) & Leonidas Moustakas (JPL/Caltech) & Risa Wechsler (Stanford)   & William Dawson (LLNL) & Annika Peter (OSU)                                            \r\n\r\n## Schedule of main session\r\n\r\n|   Time        | Speaker | Title |\r\n|:----------------|:-----------------------|:--------------------------------------------|\r\n| 2:00-2:10     | L Moustakas | Astrophysical Constraints of Dark Matter Properties | \r\n| 2:10-2:20     | W Dawson | Astronomical Insights into dark Matter Particle Constraints | \r\n| 2:20-2:30     | M Buckley | Present View of Experimental Dark Matter Particle Properties | \r\n| 2:30-2:40     | A Peter | The Future of Astronomical Dark Matter Probes | \r\n| 2:40-2:50     | J Gaskins | Astronomical Metrics for Characterizing Dark Matter | \r\n| 2:50-3:00     | E Tollerud | Future Observations and Simulations for Dark Matter | \r\n| 3:00-3:10     | M Collins | A Plan for Astrophysical Constraints of Dark Matter Properties|\r\n| 3:10-3:30     | J Gaskins and A Peter | Moderated Discussion and Conclusions | \r\n\r\n## Special Session Posters\r\n\r\nPoster session #337 in Exhibit Hall A is associated with this event, and can be viewed the entire day, with a focus at 5:30-6:30pm. \r\n\r\n| Author   |  Title   |\r\n|------------------------|:---------------|\r\n| Alex Drlica-Wagner | Searching for Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies with DES and the Fermi-LAT | \r\n| Matthew Buckley | Search for Gamma-ray Emission from Dark Matter Annihilation in the Magellanic Clouds with the Fermi Large Area Telescope | \r\n| Stacy Kim | Constraining Self-Interacting Dark Matter: Insights from Equal Mass Mergers of Galaxy Clusters |\r\n| Michelle Collins | The dark matter content of Local Group dwarf spheroidals | \r\n| Andrew Pace | Diversity of Galactic Rotation Curves and Self-interacting Dark Matter | \r\n| Leonidas Moustakas | The Aspen Framework for Dark Matter Substructure Inference from Strong Gravitational Lensing Observations |\r\n| Alyson Brooks | Assessing Astrophysical Uncertainties in Direct Detection Experiments Using Galaxy Simulations | \r\n| Tansu Daylan | Inference of Dim Gamma-Ray Point Sources Using Probabilistic Catalogues | \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
